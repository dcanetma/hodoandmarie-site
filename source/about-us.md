Maria is a catalan-born architect that met Hodei when studying graphic design. She always loved geometry, drawing and mountain hiking.

<br>

Hodei is a basque-born designer that fell in love with Maria when studying in Barcelona. Heâ€™s passionate about cycling and giving motion to our ideas.

<br>

We enjoy all the creative process, from the concept phase and the research involved. And nothing makes us happier than when the client appreciates our work together.

Always interested in new challenges.
