We met in Barcelona wile studying Graphic design and, some years after different working experiences, we joined forces in our studio hodo&marie.

<br>

Maria is a catalan-born architect who always loved drawing, geometry and colors.

<br>

Hodei is a basque-born designer passionate about cycling and motion graphics.

<br>

We enjoy all the creative process, from the concept phase and the research involved. And nothing makes us happier than when the client appreciates our work together.

Always interested in new challenges.
