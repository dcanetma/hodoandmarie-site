Graphic identity for a new pharmacy located in the city of Lleida, Catalunya.

	>	_Some images here x2 and x3 columns_

Ciutat Jardí means «Garden City» and it’s the name of the neighbourhood where the pharmacy is located.
We designed the logo and brand identity using old medical plants illustrations mixed with a fresh looking image.
